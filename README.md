## Deploys

- `stable` branch: <https://wallet.oasis.io>
- `master` branch: <https://wallet.stg.oasis.io>

## Features

- Opening wallets through private key or mnemonic
- Transaction history, currently all transactions are listed
- Multiple languages (English and French currently supported)
- Submitting transactions
- [Ledger](http://ledger.com/) support
- Multiple accounts open in parallel
- Staking (Adding / reclaiming escrow)

## Getting started

### Installing and running oasis-wallet

You can quickly get started with the following commands:

```shell
yarn install
yarn start
```

Alternatively, to get started with a local network:

```shell
docker-compose up --build -d
yarn install
REACT_APP_LOCALNET=1 yarn start
```

Then go to <http://localhost:3000> to access the wallet.

### Test accounts

The local single-node network used for development comes built-in with two
accounts already having tokens.

```none
Using a private key:

```

## Architecture

Oasis-wallet needs multiple components to run, all provided in the
[docker-compose.yml] for local development.

![Architecture diagram](docs/images/architecture.svg)

- [envoy-proxy], used as a gRPC gateway for live access to the oasis-node, to
  fetch live balance, information about the current state of the network, and to
  submit transactions.
- [oasis-monitor], a block indexer to store historical data about transactions,
  accounts, validators, rewards, blocks and more. It exposes an
  [OpenAPI][monitor-swagger]. `oasis-monitor` requires two databases:

  - A PostgreSQL instance to keep track of it's import batches
  - A [Clickhouse] server to store the indexed data

- [oasis-scan], oasis blockchain explorer that enables view of historical data
  about transactions, accounts, validators, paratimes, blocks, proposals and
  more. It exposes an [API][scan-api-repo].

API that web wallet is using is determined during a build time.

## Contributing & development

### Running the tests

The repository has two different test strategies:

- E2E (End-to-end) tests, run with [Cypress], located in [cypress/](/cypress).
  These tests require the react app to be accessible on port `3000` and the
  docker-compose stack to be up.
- Unit & functional tests, run with [Jest], located throughout the codebase

To run all tests:

```bash
# Check typescript errors
yarn checkTs

# Run jest tests
yarn test

# Run playwright tests
yarn start
(cd playwright; yarn; npx playwright install --with-deps)
(cd playwright; yarn test)
# Or set BASE_URL and EXTENSION_PATH to test production builds.
# Or `xvfb-run yarn test` to prevent browser windows opening.

# Run cypress tests
docker-compose up -d
# Run this in another terminal to keep it open
REACT_APP_LOCALNET=1 REACT_APP_BACKEND=oasismonitor yarn start
yarn cypress:run

# Manually check that content-security-policy in getSecurityHeaders.js doesn't
# break any functionality
yarn start:prod
# Open http://localhost:5000/account/oasis1qq3xrq0urs8qcffhvmhfhz4p0mu7ewc8rscnlwxe/stake
# and switch to testnet. This exercises at least: fonts, grpc, testnet grpc, API,
# and validator logos.
```

### Code style

This repository uses [prettier] as a code formatter and [eslint] as it's linter.
You can use the following commands:

```bash
# Lint the whole repository
yarn lint

# Fix linting issues
yarn lint:fix
```

#### Git Commit Messages

A quick summary:

- Separate subject from body with a blank line.
- Limit the subject line to 72 characters.
- Capitalize the subject line.
- Do not end the subject line with a period.
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move component to..." not "Moves component to...").
- Wrap the body at 80 characters.
- Use the body to explain _what_ and _why_ vs. _how_.

### Internationalization

Translating: We have [Transifex] to easily contribute translations.

Development: Oasis Wallet uses [react-i18next] for internationalization. You can
simply use the [useTranslation hook] inside your components to add additional
translation-ready strings. You can then export the new keys to the
[English translation.json] by running `yarn run extract-messages`.

Updating from [Transifex]: [English translation.json] is set as an automatically
updating resource in Transifex, so the new translation strings will appear in
Transifex a few hours after changes are merged. After they are translated, click
"Download for use" on each language, and create a new pull request with title
_"i18n: Update translations from Transifex"_.

Adding a new language:

1. first add it to Transifex and translate the strings,
2. create a folder with the new language code in `src/locales` and download the
    translation file there,
3. add the new language to the [list of resources][i18n.ts]
